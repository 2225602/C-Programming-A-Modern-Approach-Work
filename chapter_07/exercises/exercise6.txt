Q. For each of the following items of data,
specify which one of the types char, short,
int, or long is the smallest one guaranteed to
be large enough to store the item.

(a) Days in a month (b) Days in a year (c)
Minutes in a day (d) Seconds in a day

A. These answers are all assuming that the types
are signed:

(a) There can be up to 31 days in a month,
so char should be the appropriate type.

(b) There's 365 days in a year so a short type
should be suitable.

(c) There's 1440 minutes in a day; short type
is also suitable.

(d) There's 86400 seconds in a day, so an int
type should be used (unless if on a 16-bit
machine, in which case long must be used.)
