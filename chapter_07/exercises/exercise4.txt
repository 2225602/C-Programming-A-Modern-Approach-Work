Q. If c is a variable of type char, which one
of the following statements is illegal?

(a) i += c; /* i has type int */
(b) c = 2 * c - 1;
(c) putchar(c);
(d) printf(c);

A. (b) is problematic since it may cause a narrowing effect 
when the value is assigned to c, but it isn't illegal, so (d) is illegal.
