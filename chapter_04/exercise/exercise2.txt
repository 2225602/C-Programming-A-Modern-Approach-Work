If i and j are positive integers, does (-i) / j
always have the same value as - (i / j)? Justify
your answer.

-> Not necessarily. We know that the division
rules with one of the operands being negative
differs from C89 and C99.  In C89, (-i) / j
may have a different value from - (i / j) since
the first expression's value may be rounded up
or down depending on the implementation while
the second one is guaranteed to be rounded down
before applying the negative operator.

In C99, (-i) / j and - (i / j) are guaranteed to
have both the same values since both expressions
will be guaranteed to be truncated towards zero.
