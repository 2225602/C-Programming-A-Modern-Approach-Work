Q. Which one of the following statements is not equivalent to the other
two (assuming that the loop bodies are the same)?

(a) while (i < 10) {...}
(b) for (; i < 10;) {...}
(c) do {...} while (i < 10);

A. Choice c is different because it is guaranteed to execute the 
loop body at least once. Choices a and b while perform the comparison
first before evaluating the body.
